      Hi 
there’s something I’ve been holding onto, and I think it’s time I share it with you. I’ve tried to find the right words, 
but honestly, words can’t describe what I feel..You have this way of making everything around you feel warmer, more alive,
 There’s something in the way you smile, the way your eyes light up when you talk about something .The way you make 
 everyone around you feel special. And every time I’m near you, It’s like the universe is telling me that this is a moment 
 I don’t want to let slip by.I never expected to feel this way, but now I can’t ignore it anymore I’ve fallen for you. 
 And I don’t just mean in a casual way. I mean in a way that’s deep, that makes me want to be there for you, care for you,
and share every little thing with you. You’ve become someone so important to me, and every moment with you feels like a beautiful
 dream I don’t want to wake up from.I’m not asking for anything right now, I just wanted to be honest about how I feel because 
 I can’t keep this to myself anymore. You mean more to me .more than words can't describe, and I’d love to see where this journey takes us, 
 if you’d like to take that step with me."
 <p>Well you might ask me why I like you. I don’t really have a clear answer. It’s like trying to explain why 
    the sun feels warm or why the sky looks so beautiful at dusk. It’s just there. Maybe it’s the way you make me feel when you smile, 
    or how everything feels better when I’m with you. Sometimes, love doesn’t need a reason, it just happens, and I think that’s what
     makes it so special. It’s just the way you make my heart feel, even when I can’t put it into words.
 And I know you like harry Potter not me But I can't hold this inside me for so long Aur if you don't like me than bata diyo 
Ye Mt sochiyo ki friendship khrab ho jayegi Iski tension mt liyo Mai hamesa tera dost bana rahuga 
Soo don't worry</p>
